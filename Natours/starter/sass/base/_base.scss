    use 10px so it will be easy to compute e.g. in body 1.6rem which is 1.6*10 i.e. 16 px 
    THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE TO USE px ALL OTHER USES rem
    change here and ONLY here so ALL rem based dimensions : font-size , padding , ... 
    will have diffrent pixel size

    This is a pillar of responsive web design
